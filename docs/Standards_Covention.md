# Standards & Coding Conventions
## AWKWARD LEGACY Project Guidelines


## Communication & Workflow

### Discord Channels
- **#general** - Project updates and announcements
- **#development** - Code discussions and technical issues
- **#testing** - QA updates and bug reports
- **#documentation** - Docs reviews and updates

### GitHub Project Board
- **Backlog/To be Done** - All project tasks and user stories
- **In Progress** - Currently active work
- **Review** - Code review and testing phase
- **Done** - Completed and merged features

### Daily Workflow
1. Check Discord for updates
2. Review GitHub project board assignments
3. Create feature branch from `main`
4. Work on assigned tasks
5. Commit with conventional commits
6. Create PR when ready
7. Update Discord with progress

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
```
main            # Production-ready code
dev             # Integration branch
feature/xyz     # Feature development
```

### Conventional Commits
Use conventional commit format for all commits:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description

# Examples:
feat(genealogy): add heir calculation function
fix(database): resolve person lookup error
docs(readme): update setup instructions
test(heirs): add unit tests for inheritance
refactor(calculator): simplify relationship logic
style(format): apply black formatting
```

#### Commit Types
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `test` - Adding/updating tests
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `style` - Formatting, no logic change


### Pull Request Process
1. **Create PR** with descriptive title
2. **Fill template** with changes summary
3. **Request review** from team member
4. **Address feedback** if needed
5. **Merge** after approval

## Code Standards


### Naming Conventions
```python
# Variables and functions
person_id = "john_1820"
heir_count = 5

def calculate_inheritance():
    pass

# Constants
MAX_GENERATIONS = 10
DEFAULT_INHERITANCE_RULES = {}

# Classes
class FamilyTree:
    pass

class InheritanceCalculator:
    pass
```


### Error Handling

TO BE DONE

## Testing Standards



### Test Categories
