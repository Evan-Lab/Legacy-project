## Week of September 29, 2025
### Major Conflict & Template Translation Pivot

**Date:** September 29 - October 5, 2025  
**Attendees:** All team members (5/5)  
**Duration:** 6 hours (emergency extended meeting)  
**Meeting Type:** Crisis Resolution & Strategic Pivot

---

### **CRITICAL INCIDENT: General Team Confrontation**

**Issue:** Complete project standstill due to team discord

**Complaints:**
- "We're making zero progress"
- "Everyone is working on different things"
- "The approach isn't working"
- "We're going to fail at this rate"

### Breakthrough Discovery

**Finding:** Located template rendering system for frontend

**Analysis:**
- Templates in OCaml syntax generate HTML
- ~200+ template files identified
- Frontend rendering separate from backend logic
- Potential for isolated migration approach

### New Strategy Proposed

**Approach:** Focus on template layer migration

**Plan:**
1. Translate OCaml templates to Jinja2
2. Use AI assistance for conversion
3. Link converted templates to Python backend (FastAPI)
4. Ignore complex backend logic temporarily

### Live Coding Session

**Activity:** Team live-coding exercise to validate approach

**Process:**
- Selected simple template as proof-of-concept
- Used AI (ChatGPT/Claude) to translate OCaml → Jinja2
- Created corresponding FastAPI route
- Successfully rendered converted template

**Result:** ✅ Working example achieved

### Decisions Made

**Consensus (Majority):** Proceed with template translation strategy

**Reasoning:**
- Tangible, visible progress possible
- AI can accelerate translation
- Isolated scope more manageable
- Frontend migration achievable

### **DISSENTING VOICES: Critical Warning**

**Members Julia and Baptiste raised concerns:**

**Concerns:**
- "This might be a trap"
- "Maybe we're missing the real objective"
- "Is the project actually about coding or something else?"
- "Are we being tested on our project management, not migration?"

**Team Response:**
- Concerns acknowledged but not prioritized
- Majority saw live coding success as validation
- Optimism from working example overshadowed doubts
- Decision: Continue with template approach

**Julia and Baptiste's Position:**
- ⚠️ Not convinced this is the right direction
- ⚠️ Suspect hidden pedagogical goals
- ⚠️ Concerned about evaluation criteria mismatch
- ❌ Outvoted by majority enthusiasm

### Task Allocation

| Member | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| Maxime | Template conversion automation script |

### Senior Developer Consultations

**Professionals Consulted:**
- Senior Developers
- Software Architects

**Questions Asked:**
1. "Is migrating 150k lines of OCaml to Python in 1 month realistic for 5 junior developers?"
2. "What would industry-standard timeline and resources look like?"
3. "Could this be a project management test rather than a coding test?"

### **Senior Developer Consensus: UNANIMOUS**

**Response:**
> "This is impossible. No professional team could do this in your constraints. This is clearly a management test, not a coding test."

**Key Points Raised:**

1. **Scope Impossibility**
   - Estimated effort: 180-240 person-months
   - Your capacity: 1.5 person-months
   - Gap: 99%+ shortfall

2. **Professional Validation**
   - "If juniors brought me this project, I'd tell them to recognize the trap"
   - "The skill being tested is knowing when to say 'this is impossible'"
   - "Your documentation and justification are worth more than broken code"

3. **Evaluation Clues**
   - Review 1: Criticized lack of documentation
   - Review 2: Didn't even look at code, asked about justifications


### **Critical Confrontation: Team Response to JUlia**

**Team's Reaction:**
> "Why didn't you bring this to us sooner? We wasted 3 weeks!"

**Julia's Defense:**
- Raised concerns in Week 3 (September 29)
