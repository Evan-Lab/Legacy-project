# Quality Assurance Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) strategy implemented for the GeneWeb Legacy Migration Project, focusing on ensuring stability, reliability, and functional integrity throughout the modernization process.

Given the project’s legacy constraints, the QA approach centers on end-to-end (E2E) testing, supported by structured testing procedures, coding standards, and validation protocols. The E2E framework, developed with Cypress, comprehensively verifies user interactions, navigation flows, data handling, and template rendering ensuring that all critical functionalities perform as intended across the application.

In addition to automated testing, quality assurance measures included code reviews, accessibility verification, and translation validation for all templates, ensuring compliance with usability and disability standards. These combined efforts provide a high level of confidence in the system’s operational readiness and maintainability.

Overall, this QA process establishes a sustainable foundation for future improvements, enabling consistent quality monitoring and smoother iteration cycles for subsequent development phases.
