# Security Analysis & Mitigation Plan
## AWKWARD LEGACY - Genealogy Security Assessment


## Security Context

**Project:** Legacy OCaml GeneWeb to Python conversion  
**Critical Data:** Historical genealogical records (1995-2008) with personal information of thousands of users  
**Compliance:** GDPR requirements for personal data protection  
**Environment:** Local deployment with potential multi-user access

## OWASP Top 10 Risk Assessment

Based on our project analysis, we've identified the following priority security risks:

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY RISKS

#### 1. Cryptographic Failures (#2)
**Problem:** No encryption for data storage and transmission  
**Impact:** Personal data of thousands of users stored and transferred in plain text  
**GDPR Violation:** Potential breach of personal data protection requirements

#### 2. Vulnerable and Outdated Components (#6) 
**Problem:** Legacy dependencies and potential outdated libraries  
**Impact:** Known vulnerabilities in third-party components  
**Risk:** Exploitation through dependency vulnerabilities

#### 3. Software and Data Integrity Failures (#8)
**Problem:** Weak DevOps pipeline and security processes  
**Impact:** Malicious updates or compromised dependencies (like Jia Tan incident)  
**Risk:** Supply chain attacks through Git contributions or dependencies

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY RISKS

#### 4. Injection Attacks (#3)
**Problem:** Potential SQL injection in genealogy data queries  
**Impact:** Access to unauthorized genealogical data  
**Risk:** Data breaches through malicious input

#### 5. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (#9)
**Problem:** No security logging system identified  
**Impact:** Inability to detect security incidents  
**Risk:** Undetected breaches and compliance issues
