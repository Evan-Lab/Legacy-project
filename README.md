# AWKWARD LEGACY
**Project Overview our Legacy project**


---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Client:** CoinLegacy Inc.  
**Project:** GeneWeb Legacy Modernization & Quality Assurance  
**Duration:** September - October 2025  
**Team:** 5-person development team  
**Approach:** Strategic documentation, testing, and proof-of-concept over full rewrite

### Mission Statement

CoinLegacy Inc. has acquired legacy OCaml genealogy software (GeneWeb, 1995-2008) containing sophisticated algorithms for identifying rightful heirs of powerful lineages. Our mission: **restore, test, and deploy** this system in compliance with modern quality standards **without rewriting or destroying its historical core**.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** "This is a piece of history. Rewriting or destroying it is out of the question — doing so would get you fired." — Project Brief

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### Core Deliverables

This project focuses on **Quality Assurance** and **Project Management** competencies:

✅ **Test Policy:** Documented testing strategy with 477 E2E tests  
✅ **Quality Processes:** Standards, conventions, and QA framework  
✅ **Security Audit:** Comprehensive vulnerability analysis (371 issues detected)  
✅ **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG  audit (534 issues identified)  
✅ **Deployment Expertise:** Infrastructure design and security best practices  
✅ **Strategic Documentation:** 11 professional documents  

### What We Did NOT Do (By Design)

❌ **Full OCaml → Python migration** (150k+ LOC = 180-240 person-months required)  
❌ **Rewrite the core system** (explicitly forbidden by project brief)  
❌ **Modify legacy algorithms** (risk of breaking historical functionality)

**Why?** Our technical analysis proved full migration impossible within constraints. We pivoted to a **consulting approach**: analyze, test, document, and provide actionable roadmap for future teams.

## ♿ Accessibility Compliance

**📖 [Accessibility Audit Report →](docs/Accessibility.md)**

### Audit Results (djLint Static Analysis)

We performed comprehensive WCAG 2.1 accessibility analysis using automated linting:

| Severity | Count | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical (Level A) | 52 | Screen reader blockers |
| 🟠 High (Level AA) | 159 | Usability issues |
| 🟡 Low | 323 | Code quality |
| **Total Issues** | **534** | **Non-compliant** |

**Key Findings:**
- ❌ 47 images missing alt attributes (H013)
- ❌ 3 pages missing title tags (H016)
- ❌ 2 pages missing lang attribute (H005)
- ⚠️ 89 images missing dimensions (CLS issues)

## 🔒 Security Audit

**📖 [Security Audit Report →](docs/Security.md)**

### Vulnerability Assessment

Automated security scanning detected **371 vulnerabilities** using custom Python static analysis:

| Severity | Count | CVSS Score | Status |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|
| 🔴 HIGH | 3 | 7.5-8.6 | Urgent fix required |
| 🟠 MEDIUM | 3 | 5.0-6.5 | Should fix |
| 🟡 LOW | 365 | 4.3 | Low priority |

### Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

1. **Plain-Text Password Storage (CWE-256, CVSS 7.5)**
   - Location: `etc/a.gwf`, `distribution/gw/a.gwf`
   - Risk: Credential theft if files accessed
   - Mitigation: Use digest authentication or external auth layer

2. **Missing HTTPS/TLS (CWE-319, CVSS 7.4)**
   - Risk: Man-in-the-middle attacks, credential theft
   - Mitigation: Deploy behind reverse proxy with SSL/TLS termination

3. **No CSRF Protection (CWE-352, CVSS 6.5)**
   - Risk: Unauthorized actions via forged requests
   - Mitigation: Implement CSRF tokens at proxy level

This project has been both a technical and human journey : full of challenges, learning, and perseverance.
There were highs and lows, moments of stress, disagreements, and failed experiments. But through it all, we stayed committed and worked with the resources and availability we had.

We learned how to collaborate under real project conditions: dealing with uncertainty, unexpected issues, and time constraints.
We experienced what it means to pivot strategically when a goal becomes unrealistic, to communicate transparently as a team, and to focus on what truly brings value.

From late debugging sessions or meeting to refining our E2E testing and improving documentation, every step helped us grow  not only as developers, but as future professionals capable of delivering under pressure.

In the end, this project taught us that success is not just about delivering features, but about learning to adapt, to prioritize quality, and to finish strong with honesty and professionalism. We hope to pass this project during our presentation...
